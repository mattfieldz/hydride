The 1D_condon produces code solving the condon equation shifting x_c across and then plots the value of the interface against time

Can vary $m$, $c_s$, diffusivities and kstar

Has comparison to asymptotics which is typically good but small time growth is fast and hence there is a vertical offset by some constant.
Zooming out enough makes this offset seem small but is disingenuous
